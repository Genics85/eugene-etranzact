- I used Long for the Id instead of Int because a banking system user base can grow to a very huge number thereby chosing Long over int because it can give you a lot of numbers 
- I check whether the account has enough balance balance withdrawal is allowed because, you cant withdraw more than what you have in a bank account
- Also I get the user details from the get method i created in the services in the other functions such as delete,update and delete so that the server exception will be thrown when it is not found
- And for the withdrawal I check to make sure the user initiated the withdrawal himself before transaction is allowed to proceed to avoid theft from third parties
